This project was theoretically supposed to be carried out by four people, but just two members of the group have made it.

Not a single meeting was held, as one of the members was 'never available'. He had a completely passive attitude towards this project, not caring about its completion. The only thing that he did was writing a couple of paragraphs in the last week before the deadline that were a whole bunch of nonsense, such as calculating the brake thrust $\Delta V_1$, which is given at the beginning in the definition of the problem.

The other member had a more positive attitude, but claiming a complete lack of understanding and complaining about a heavy workload due to other subjects, he didn't make anything until four days before the deadline. As they both had to work on the same part of the project, he was supposed to correct the mistakes of the first one. Two days before deadline the mistakes were still there. Those mistakes are not a consequence of the difficulty of the project, they are caused by a total lack of attention.   

For the reasons exposed, we consider that this project should not be taken into consideration in their final mark, as this rewards this kind of behavior towards teamwork ("let them work, I'll pass doing nothing"). All in all, it makes group work unfair and painful for the ones that really make it.
